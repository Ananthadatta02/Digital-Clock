# Digital-Clock
A simple web-based digital clock that displays the current time, date, and day of the week. The clock updates every second and the background changes dynamically based on the day of the week. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project demonstrates real-time system integration and interactive web design.

## Features
- Displays **live time** in 12-hour format (AM/PM).
- Displays **current date** in `DD-MM-YYYY` format.
- Shows the **day of the week**.
- Changes the **background image** daily, based on the day of the week.
- Time and date are based on your system's local time.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML** - Structure and content of the digital clock.
- **CSS** - Styling for the clock and layout.
- **JavaScript** - Logic for fetching system time, date, and handling the background image change.

## How It Works
- The clock fetches the current system time and displays it, updating every second.
- The date is displayed in the format `DD-MM-YYYY`, and the day of the week is shown.
- The background image changes daily using an array of images, one for each day of the week.

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open `digitalClock.html` in a web browser to view the clock.

## Future Enhancements
- Option to customize the background image.
- Add a 24-hour clock option.
