# Digital-Clock
This project is a digital clock built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It displays the current time, date, and day, updating every second. The background changes dynamically based on the day of the week. The clock uses a sleek, responsive design with modern CSS styling, including blur effects and text shadows.
